Problem Domain:

The problem domain our group would like to focus on is simple gaming. Some basic knowledge of gaming would be required to understand the project. 


Our Application:

Our team would like to develop a game which is based on luck mostly. It is a one player game against the computer where the characters are assigned randomly. Each character has certain statistics which make them stronger or weaker than the computers'. The more games you win against the computer, the more of the character cards you get in your bounty. However, this depends entirely on the stats of your randomly assigned card. The aim of this game is for the user to get all the cards in the system, possibly before the computer does.

We aim to use two API's to make this possible:

1. OPENAI API (GPT and DALL - E)
    https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview

   We believe GPT will be useful for the random generation of stats and general randomness of our game. DALL- E will be useful for generating images of our randomised playable characters.


2. Google
   https://developers.google.com/explorer-help

   We wanted to embed this in the user sign up/login part of our game.



Here are some screenshots of us trying out the aformentioned APIS on (API trying website):

And the example output from running some Java code:

For now, we don't see any technical problems blocking our progress.
